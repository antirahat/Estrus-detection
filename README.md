# Estrus-detection

Through cowdy we aim to detect precise estrus period, potential disease and abnormality among your cattle and ensure high production yield of your livestock farm. 

## How does it works

According to hypothesis that data should look like this:

and we can divide this informations into three following segments - Feeding, resting, remuniation like this:

Data taken by devices from iFarmer:

Charts illustrating successful estrus detection in subsequent 6 months (August-December 2019). Penultimate estrus (on December 4), was not measured due to a power outage in the farm buildings.
